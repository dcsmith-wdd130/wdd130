        <p>My name is Colby Smith. I am born and raised in Vancouver Washington. I am a Biology major and I intend on becoming an optometrist. I was born into the church and had the opportunity to serve a Full-time mission. I was assigned to Limatambo Peru, but due to COVID I was reassigned to Baltimore, Maryland. I recently got married to my wife who is also from Vancouver. I have 1 brother and 3 sisters. My dad and my older brother are both students here at BYU-Idaho as well which is a fun experience. </p>
        <p>Here is a picture of my family at my wedding!</p>
