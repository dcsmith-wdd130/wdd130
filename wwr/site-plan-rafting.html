      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of the Extreme River Rafting website is to provide
        information about our rafting company and what our company has to offer.
        To provide a pleasant browsing experience to the visitor for research of
        available short and long rafting excursions for individuals or groups.
        They will also be able to find answers to common questions and contact
        us to schedule an excursion.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Our target audience is younger individuals or groups that are interested
        in extreme sporting type activities as well as families looking for fun,
        safe, vacation activities. We provide a one time service for individuals
        that are interested in a safe rafting adventure but don't want to pay
        the money, or have the space, to outfit themselves with rafting
        equipment long term at this point.
