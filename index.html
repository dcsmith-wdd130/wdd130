        My name is Colby Smith. I am born and raised in Vancouver Washington. I
        am a Biology major and I intend on becoming an optometrist. I was born
        into the church and had the opportunity to serve a Full-time mission. I
        was assigned to Limatambo Peru, but due to COVID I was reassigned to
        Baltimore, Maryland. I recently got married to my wife who is also from
        Vancouver. I have 1 brother and 3 sisters. My dad and my older brother
        are both students here at BYU-Idaho as well which is a fun experience.
